# shopping-site

This project is a simple static frontend shopping website, possibly for displaying products like clothes, with basic interactivity such as adding items to the cart. 
The styling relies on flexbox and standard CSS techniques, which makes the layout flexible and responsive. 
The background image adds a visual appeal, and the website is designed to be visually accessible with light text on a dark background.
